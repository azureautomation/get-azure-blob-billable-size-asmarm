Get Azure Blob Billable Size [ASM/ARM]
======================================

            

**Description**


Retrieves the effective size that is being used by one (or several) Blobs, all blobs in a container or a storage account, including the metadata.


This is a reworked and updated script by the
[Windows Azure Product Team](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Get-Billable-Size-of-32175802#content) (kudos to them!) in order to work with ARM cmdlets. A new feature has also been added which allows the user to query the size of one or more blobs specifically.


 


**Example**


 

 

 


**Requirements**


 


  *  PowerShell 5.1

  *  Azure PowerShell 4.4.1 or above

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
